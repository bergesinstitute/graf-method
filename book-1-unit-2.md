    Alto/Bajo - Tall/Short

    Feliz (N)/Triste (N) - Happy/Sad

    Enojado - Angry

## How they work with *ser* and *estar*:

Examples using *ser* (with permanent attributes): *Yo soy alto, ella es pequeña, ellos son grandes.*

Examples using *estar* (with non-permanent attributes): *Yo estoy enojado, Juan está triste, 
nosotros estamos cansados.*

# Spanish prepositions

Prepositions are words that express relationships between two words (usually spatial or temporal).

    De - From, of

    En - In, on, at

*El abuelo es de España. El abuelo está en Nueva York.* (The grandfather is from Spain. 
The grandfather is in New York.) Notice the use of *ser* and *estar*. Since *de* implies origin, 
we will always use it with *ser*. Since *en* implies location, we will always use it with *estar*.

# Spanish adverbs

Adverbs are words that describe verbs or adjectives. They don't have gender or number. Here's an important one:

    Muy - Very

*Yo estoy muy cansado.* (I am very tired.) 

# Basic words and expressions in Spanish

    Sí - yes

    No - no

# Spanish conjunctions

Conjunctions are words used to connect words or sentences together.

    Y - and

    O - or

    Pero - but

*Yo soy de Madrid y Laura es de Barcelona. Juan está enojado o cansado. Yo estoy en Nueva York, 
pero Pedro está en Londres.* (I am from Madrid and Laura is from Barcelona. Juan is either angry 
or tired. I am in New York, but Pedro is in London.)

# Possessive adjectives in Spanish

## Possessive adjectives

Possessive adjectives show possession. In Spanish, we have different ones for one thing possessed 
or more than one thing possessed.

## One thing possessed

    First-Person Singular: Mi (My)

    Second-Person Singular: Tu (Your, singular)

    Third-Person Singular: Su (His / Her)

    First-Person Plural: Nuestro / Nuestra (Our)

    Second Person Plural: Vuestro / Vuestra (Your, plural)

    Third Person Plural: Su (Their)

## More than one thing possessed

    First-Person Singular: Mis (My)

    Second-Person Singular: Tus (Your, singular)

    Third-Person Singular: Sus (His / Her)

    First-Person Plural: Nuestros / Nuestras (Our)

    Second Person Plural: Vuestros / Vuestras (Your, plural)

    Third Person Plural: Sus (Their)

Some examples: *mi casa, mis carros, sus tíos, nuestras casas, tus abuelos.*

> Notice how the subject of the sentence is the object or the animal possessed: Mi gato es rojo 
> uses the third person conjugation (*él*), not the first person conjugation (*yo*). The subject is the cat, not me.

## Full way of expressing possession

When we are not using possessives and saying who the person is, in Spanish we cannot use *'s* (Juan's house). 
We have to say *la casa de Juan* (the house of Juan).

# Introducing yourself in Spanish

Here's an easy formula:

    Hola. - Hello.

    ¿Cuál es tu nombre? - What (lit. which) is your name?

    Mi nombre es Juan. - My name is Juan.

    Mucho gusto. - Nice to meet you.
 
> Notice we use an opening inverted question mark: ¿………? Same for ¡……!

# Asking questions in Spanish

## Interrogative pronouns

    Qué - What

    Dónde - Where

    Cuándo - When

    Cómo - How

    Quién - Who

    Cuánto - How much/how many

    Por qué - Why

    Cuál - Which

They all have an accent (´) on their strong syllable.

> *Cuál* is usually used before *es* (and other forms of *ser*) instead of *qué* when not seeking a definition:
*What's your phone number? ¿Cuál es tu número de teléfono?*
*What is your address? ¿Cuál es tu dirección?*

## Example

> When we speak, we frequently omit the personal pronoun, since it's implied in the conjugation of the verb: 
we say *estoy triste* instead of *yo estoy triste*, or *eres alto* instead of *tú eres alto*.

    ¿De dónde eres? - Where are you from? (Lit. “From where are you?”)

    Soy de Madrid. - I am from Madrid.

    ¿Dónde está Madrid? - Where is Madrid?

    Madrid está en España. - Madrid is in Spain.

# Talking about your favorite things in Spanish

For asking *what is your favorite _____?* we use *cuál*. We literally ask *which is your favorite _____?*

Here are some examples:

    ¿Cuál es tu color favorito? (Lit. Which is your favorite color?)

    Mi color favorito es rojo. (My favorite color is red.)

    ¿Cuál es tu animal favorito? (Lit. Which is your favorite animal?)

    Mi animal favorito es el gato. (My favorite animal is the cat.)

Some more nouns:

    El libro - the book

    La película - the movie

    La ciudad - the city

    El equipo de fútbol - the football/soccer team

    La canción - the song
