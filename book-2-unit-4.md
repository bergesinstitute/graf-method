# Antes, después, and durante

    Antes - before

    Después - after

    Durante - during

*Antes* and *después* are followed by the preposition *de* when they are used to place an event in relation 
to a certain point in time:

*Visité a mi amiga antes de la fiesta.* (I visited my friend before the party.)

*Antes del\* desayuno siempre corro en el parque.* (Before breakfast I always run in the park.)

*Después del\* concierto fuimos a un restaurante.* (After the concert we went to a restaurant.)

*Después de las 5 nunca miro televisión.* (After 5 I never watch TV.)

> *When we use the preposition *de* followed by the article *el*, we need to merge them together into *del.*

Also, when we place an event before or after an action (after running, before eating…), in Spanish we always 
use the infinitive form of the verb (*correr, comer,* etc.):

*Después de cenar, fuimos al parque.*

*Antes de correr, nunca bebo mucha agua.*

*Ayer fui al gimnasio. Después de ir al gimnasio, desayuné. Después de desayunar,trabajé. 
Después de trabajar, fui al supermercado.*

*Durante* is never followed by *de:*

*Miré la televisión durante la cena.*

*Durante el desayuno nunca leo el periódico* (the newspaper).

Also, *durante* cannot be used with verbs (we can't say *durante cenar,* we have to say *durante la cena*).

# Spanish demonstrative adjectives and pronouns

## Degrees

While in English there are only two degrees of distance (here and there), in Spanish we have three degrees 
of distance: *aquí* (here), *ahí* (there), and *allí/allá* (there, but further than ahí). 

## First degree

    Adverb: Aquí (here)

    Masculine singular: Este (this)

    Masculine plural: Estos (these)

    Feminine singular: Esta (this)

    Feminine plural: Estas (these)

    Neutral: Esto (this)

## Second degree

    Adverb: Ahí (there)

    Masculine singular: Ese (that)

    Masculine plural: Esos (those)

    Feminine singular: Esa (that)

    Feminine plural: Esas (those)

    Neutral: Eso (that)

## Third degree

    Adverb: Allí/Allá (there)

    Masculine singular: Aquel (that)

    Masculine plural: Aquellos (those)

    Feminine singular: Aquella (that)

    Feminine plural: Aquellas (those)

    Neutral: Aquello (that)

Demonstratives can be adjectives or pronouns. When they describe a noun, they are adjectives:

*Esta casa es grande. Aquel piano es negro.* (This house is big. That piano is black.)

When they are by themselves, they are pronouns. In this case, they often have an accent mark*:

*Ésta es grande. Aquél es negro.* (This one is big. That one is black.)

We use them as pronouns when we refer to something that we already mentioned, and they translate 
as *this one, these ones, that one* or *those ones,* respectively; we don't need to add *uno/una.*

> **Esto, eso* and *aquello* are always pronouns, and they never need an accent mark. 
> In every other case, we traditionally add the accent mark to “label” the demonstrative as a pronoun, 
> although it's not mandatory to do that anymore.
