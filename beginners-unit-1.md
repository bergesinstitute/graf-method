## Comments

- B & V sound the same, like a soft B. Beber = Vivir.

- Ch & Ll are consonants phonetically (they have their own sound: llave, chapa…)

- H is silent: hablar and hombre, are pronounced /ablar/, /ombre/.

- K & W are not common; they are only used for borrowed words: whisky, katana…

- R has two sounds:
  - Strong (rolling!), when it is either at the beginning of a word, doubled, or placed after N, L or S: Rata, carro, sonrisa…
  - Soft, when it is in the middle or the end of a word and not doubled: cara, para, por…
  
- Y has two sounds:
  - Vowel, when it is at the end of a word or by itself (y = and), it sounds like I: hoy, estoy…
  - Consonant, in every other scenario: yo, hoyo…

## Letters with special behaviors

### C, Q, Z and S

- C sounds /k/ with A, O and U, and /θ/ or /s/ with E and I.

- We use Qu to obtain the sound /k/ with E and I.

- The sound /θ/ is used only in Spain. In the rest of the world za, ce, ci, zo, zu would be pronounced /sa, se, si, so, su/. In Spain, it would be pronounced /θa, θe, θi, θo, θu/.

> Note: In Spanish, we can never use z with vowels e and i.

#### Some words to pronounce 

Queso, cuco, zapato, cereza, zueco, caza, casa.

Translation: Cheese, cuckoo, shoe, cherry, clog, hunting, house.

### J and G

- J sounds /x/ with all vowels, G sounds /g/ with A, O and U and /x/ with E and I.
- We place a U after the G to obtain the sound /g/ with E and I.

#### Some words to pronounce: 

Jarabe, jefe, gerente, gato, gente, ginebra, guerra, guitarra, jilguero.

Translation: Syrup, boss, manager, cat, people, gin, war, guitar, goldfinch.

> Note: Whenever we need the “u” between “g” and “e” or between “g” and “i” to be pronounced, we need to add a diéresis on top of it: pingüino, lingüística, etc.

## Spanish personal pronouns

    First-Person Singular: Yo (I)

    Second-Person Singular: Tú (You, singular)

    Third-Person Singular: Él / Ella (He / She*)

    First-Person Plural: Nosotros / Nosotras (We)

    Second Person Plural: Vosotros / Vosotras (You, plural)

    Third Person Plural: Ellos / Ellas (They)

> The neuter pronoun it is not usually expressed in Spanish. We use él/ella instead, or we just omit the pronoun and use the verb only.

Traditionally, the plural persons are used in this way: if the group of people consists of women only, we use the feminine version. If it consists of men only or both men and women, we use the masculine version (even if there are 50 women and one man!). To be inclusive, we can use some gender-neutral formulas: Nosotros y nosotras, nosotros/as or nosotr@s are common ones.

### Usted/Ustedes

We have a second-person formal pronoun that we use to express courtesy or respect. It has a second-person meaning, but it is conjugated in third person, since it comes from the old courtesy formula Vuestra Merced (Your Mercy). (We say your mercy/your majesty/your honor is—as opposed to you are. We’ll do the same thing in Spanish when we learn the verbs.)
