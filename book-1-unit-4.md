# La casa (the house)

    La casa - the house

    El cuarto - the room/the bedroom

    La sala - the living room

# There is/there are

In Spanish, we use *hay* to express either *there is* or *there are*. It doesn't matter if it's masculine, 
feminine, singular, or plural:

*Hay un piano - There is a piano*

*Hay una guitarra - There is a guitar*

*Hay unos pianos - There are some pianos*

*Hay unas guitarras - There are some guitars*

To make a sentence negative, we just place the word *no* right before *hay*:

*No hay un piano, no hay una guitarra,* etc.

We have three options when we talk about things in our house:

Option 1: *Hay una cocina grande en mi apartamento.* (There is a large kitchen in my apartment.)

Option 2: *Tengo una cocina grande en mi apartamento.* (I have a large kitchen in my apartment.)

Option 3: *Mi apartamento tiene una cocina grande.* (My apartment has a large kitchen.)

> *We must match *cuánto* in gender and number when using it with countable nouns (as in how many).
> **It is an idiomatic expression (lit. “Of what color are your chairs?”)

## Cantar (to sing), present tense

    Yo canto

    Tú cantas

    Él/Ella/Ud. canta

## How to conjugate -ar verbs

To conjugate these verbs, we need to drop the *-ar* ending and add the corresponding ending for each person.

For example:

    Trabajar - ar = trabaj

    Yo trabaj + o = yo trabajo

    Tú trabaj + as = tú trabajas

    Él trabaj + a = él trabaja

    Etc.
