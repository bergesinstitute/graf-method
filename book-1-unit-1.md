## Comments

- B & V sound the same, like a soft B. *Beber = Vivir*.
- Ch & Ll are consonants phonetically (they have their own sound: *llave, chapa…*)
- H is silent: *hablar* and *hombre* are pronounced /ablar/, /ombre/.
- K & W are not common; they are only used for borrowed words: *whisky, katana…*
- R has two sounds:
  - Strong (rolling!), when it is either at the beginning of a word, doubled, or placed after N, L or S: *Rata, carro, sonrisa…*
  - Soft, when it is in the middle or the end of a word and not doubled: *cara, para, por…*
- Y has two sounds:
  - Vowel, when it is at the end of a word or by itself (*y = and*), it sounds like I: *hoy, estoy…*
  - Consonant, in every other scenario: *yo, hoyo…*

## Letters with special behaviors

### C, Q, Z and S

- C sounds /k/ with A, O and U, and /θ/ or /s/ with E and I.
- We use QU to obtain the sound /k/ with E and I.
- The sound /θ/ is used only in Spain. In the rest of the world za, ce, ci, zo, zu would be pronounced /sa, se, si, so, su/. In Spain, it would be pronounced /θa, θe, θi, θo, θu/.

> In Spanish, we don't really use Z with vowels E and I.

#### Some words to pronounce 

*Queso, cuco, zapato, cereza, zueco, caza, casa.*

Translation: *Cheese, cuckoo, shoe, cherry, clog, hunting, house.*

### J and G

- J sounds /x/ with all vowels, G sounds /g/ with A, O and U and /x/ with E and I.
- We place a U after the G to obtain the sound /g/ with E and I.

#### Some words to pronounce: 

*Jarabe, jefe, gerente, gato, gente, ginebra, guerra, guitarra, jilguero.*

Translation: *Syrup, boss, manager, cat, people, gin, war, guitar, goldfinch.*

> Whenever we need the U between G and E or between G and I to be pronounced, we need to add a diéresis on top of it: *pingüino, lingüística.*

# Spanish personal pronouns

## Basic pronouns

    First-person singular: yo (I)

    Second-person singular: tú (you, singular)

    Third-person singular: él / ella (he / she)

    First-person plural: nosotros / nosotras (we)

    Second-person plural: vosotros / vosotras (you, plural)

    Third-person plural: ellos / ellas (they)

> The neuter pronoun *it* is not usually expressed in Spanish. We use *él/ella* instead, 
or we just omit the pronoun and use the verb only.

Traditionally, the plural persons are used in this way: if the group of people consists 
of women only, we use the feminine version. If it consists of men only or both men and women, 
we use the masculine version (even if there are 50 women and one man!). To be inclusive, 
we can use some gender-neutral formulas: *Nosotros y nosotras, nosotros/as* or *nosotr@s* are common ones.

## Usted / ustedes

We have a second-person formal pronoun that we use to express courtesy or respect. It 
has a second-person meaning, but it is conjugated in third person, since it comes from the 
old courtesy formula *vuestra merced* (*your mercy*). (We say *your mercy/your 
majesty/your honor is* — as opposed to *you are*. We'll do the same thing in Spanish when we learn the verbs.)

# Verbs ser and estar (to be)

## Ser, present tense

    yo soy

    tú eres

    él / ella / usted es

    nosotros / nosotras somos

    (vosotros/ vosotras sois)

    ellos / ellas / ustedes son

## Estar, present tense

    yo estoy

    tú estás

    él / ella / usted está

    nosotros / nosotras estamos

    (vosotros / vosotras estáis)

    ellos / ellas / ustedes están

## How to memorize the conjugations

Try to memorize them in columns, preceded by the pronoun: *Yo soy, tú eres, él/ella/usted es, 
nosotros/nosotras somos, (vosotros/vosotras sois), ellos/ellas/ustedes son. Yo estoy, 
tú estás, él/ella/usted está, nosotros/nosotras estamos, (vosotros/vosotras estáis), ellos/ellas/ustedes están.*

> In all Spanish-speaking countries, people differentiate between *tú eres* (informal) 
> versus *usted es* (formal). However, for the plural version (“you all”) this differentiation 
> only happens in Spain: *vosotros sois* (informal) versus *ustedes son* (formal).
> In the rest of the world, for “you all,” people always use the formal versión *ustedes son*. 
> Since the majority of the Spanish-speaking countries don't use *vosotros*, we can 
> choose to skip it when we learn verb conjugations.

## Ser: We use it for permanent attributes and professions.

Typical uses:

### Physical or personality traits

    Yo soy alto. (I am tall.) 

    Laura es simpática. (Laura is nice.)

### Nationality/origin

    John es de España. (John is from Spain.)

### Professions (even if they are non-permanent!)

    Maria es secretaria. (Maria is a secretary.) 

## Estar: We use it for non-permanent attributes and location.

Typical uses:

### Moods/physical conditions

    Yo estoy triste. (I am sad.)

    Pedro está cansado. (Pedro is tired.)

### Location (even if it is permanent!)

    Sara está en Nueva York. (Sara is in New York.)

    Madrid está en España. (Madrid is in Spain.)

## Distinguishing example:

    Mis ojos son azules (My eyes are blue — it's their color.)

    Mis ojos están rojos (My eyes are red — it is a non-permanent state.)

# Spanish negation

To make a sentence negative, we just place the word *no* right before the verb:

    Yo soy.

    Yo no soy.

    Ellos están.

    Ellos no están.

# Nouns in Spanish

Nouns have number: they can be singular (one) or plural (more than one). In order to make them plural, 
we add *-s* at the end, or *-es* if the noun ends in a consonant. *Guitarra → Guitarras. Doctor → Doctores.*

Nouns in Spanish have gender (they can be either masculine or feminine). A *piano* (piano) is masculine, 
while a *guitarra* (guitar) is feminine. Notice how *piano* ends in *-o* and *guitarra* ends in *-a*. 
It is quite common for masculine and feminine nouns to end in those letters respectively, but it is not 
a rule. So, in order to memorize the gender of nouns, we are going to learn all of them together with the article.

# Articles in Spanish

## Article types

There are two kinds of articles, both in Spanish and in English. In English, we have a definite 
article (*the*) that we use for nouns that are identifiable by the listener. For example, if I tell 
Mary I was at *the restaurant* last night, I'm assuming Mary knows what restaurant I am talking about.

We also have two indefinite articles (*a/some*) that we use for nouns that are not identifiable by 
the listener. If I tell Mary I was at *a restaurant* last night, it could be any restaurant, 
not a particular one that she already knows about.

Here are the articles in Spanish. They have to match the noun both in gender (masculine/feminine) 
and number (singular, i.e. one/plural, i.e. more than one).

## Definite article (the)

    el (singular, masculine)

    la (singular, feminine)

    los (plural, masculine)

    las (plural, feminine)

Examples: *El piano, los pianos, la guitarra, las guitarras.*

## Indefinite article (a/some)

    un (singular, masculine)

    una (singular, feminine)

    unos (plural, masculine)

    unas (plural, feminine)	

Examples: *Un piano, unos pianos, una guitarra, unas guitarras.*

Articles work similarly in English and in Spanish. There is one exception, though: 
in English, generic/uncountable nouns at the beginning of a sentence don't have an article:

    Cats are fun.

    Gas is expensive.

In Spanish, generic/uncountable nouns at the beginning of a sentence must have an article:

    Los gatos son divertidos.

    La gasolina es cara.

# Family members in Spanish

# Adjectives in Spanish

Adjectives describe or qualify a noun. In Spanish, they have to match in gender and number (this does not 
happen in English: we can say *the red guitar*, for singular, or *the red guitars*, for plural, 
and *red* remains the same).

Generally, adjectives in Spanish are placed after the noun:

*El piano rojo, los pianos rojos, la guitarra roja, las guitarras rojas* (for specific pianos or guitars),

or

*un piano rojo, unos pianos rojos, una guitarra roja, unas guitarras rojas* (for non-specific pianos or guitars).
