# Headings

Don't use italics in headings. Only end them in period if the heading has at least two sentences.

    This is a one-sentence heading

    This is a two sentence heading. Here is the second sentence.

# Dashes

Only use the short dash: -

# Markdown emphasis

Use * for italics, ** for bold. That said, avoid using bold for emphasis.

# Italics

Use them for foreign words, like *hablar.* Lo mismo si la oración es en español y estamos hablando del verbo *to sing.*

# Letters

When we are talking about a letter, like A, we'll capitalize it without using italics.

# Escaping asterisks

If you need to display an actual asterisk at the end of an italized word, you'll have to precede it with a backslash: \*

# Square brackets

Never use square brackets: []. They create problems when rendering to other languages.

# Comments

Leave a space between the opening sign (>) and the first word.

# Apostrophe

Only use the vertical one (')
